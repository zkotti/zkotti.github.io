I'm a Data Scientist with extensive experience in AI applications
in software engineering and recommender systems.
I was previously a Research Engineer at Delivery Hero
working on machine-learning-based recommender systems and their performance analytics.

I'm also a PhD Candidate and Associate Researcher
at the [Business Analytics Laboratory](https://www.balab.aueb.gr/),
established at the Department of Management Science and Technology,
Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece.
My doctorate has been granted a [scholarship award](https://www.elidek.gr/en/call/3rd-call-for-h-f-r-i-scholarships-for-phd-candidates/)
from the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation.

My research interests include machine learning, recommender systems, and software engineering.
