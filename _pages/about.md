I'm a PhD student at the [Business Analytics Laboratory](https://www.balab.aueb.gr/),
established at the Department of Management Science and Technology,

I hold a BSc in Management Science and Technology from the same Department.
As part of my undergraduate studies,
I conducted an industrial internship at [isMOOD Data Technology Services](https://ismood.com/)
